# LoopBack iOS SDK

## Status

As a former StrongLoop Labs project, this SDK may lack usability, completeness, documentation, and robustness, and may be outdated. StrongLoop/IBM is no longer maintaining this project actively, however we do provide support for our paying customers through usual IBM support channels.

Our recommendatios is to use [IBM Mobile First](https://www.ibm.com/mobile) platform or [Swagger codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) instead of this SDK.

We are looking for volunteers from our community to pick up the maintenance of this project, see https://github.com/strongloop-community/loopback-sdk-ios/issues/136

## Description

The LoopBack iOS SDK obviates the need for using the clunky `NSURLRequest` and
similar interfaces to interact with a LoopBack-based backend, albeit RESTful.
Instead, interact with your Models and Data Sources in a comfortable,
first-class, native manner.

> This section describes v1.1 version of the LoopBack iOS SDK. The following API
> changes were made:
>
>  - `LBModelPrototype` was renamed to `LBModelRepository`
>  - `findWithId` was renamed to `findById`
